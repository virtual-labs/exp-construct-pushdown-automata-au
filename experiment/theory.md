<h5>Pushdown Automata (PDA)</h5>
<p>A push down automata (PDA) is a way to implement a context free grammar (CFG) in a similar way to design the deterministic finite automata (DFA) for a regular grammar.A DFA can remember a finite amount of information, but a PDA can remember an infinite amount of information.
</p>
<p>PDA= "Finite state machine" + "a stack"<br>
PDA has three components, which are as follows −
<li>An input tape.</li>
<li>A control unit.</li>
<li>A stack with infinite size.</li></p>
<p>A stack does two operations − 

<li>Push − a new symbol is added at the top.</li>
<li>Pop − the top symbol is read and removed.</li>
</p>
<p>A PDA can be formally described as a 7-tuple (Q, ∑, S, δ, q0, I, F) −<br>
<li>Q is the finite number of states</li>
<li>∑ is input alphabet</li>
<li>S is stack symbols</li>
<li>δ is the transition function: Q × (∑ ∪ {ε}) × S × Q × S*</li>
<li>q0 is the initial state (q0 ∈ Q)</li>
<li>I is the initial stack top symbol (I ∈ S)</li>
<li>F is a set of accepting states (F ∈ Q)</li>
<p>PDA Components:</p>
<p>Input tape: The input tape is divided in many cells or symbols. The input head is read-only and may only move from left to right, one symbol at a time.</p>

<p>Finite control: The finite control has some pointer which points the current symbol which is to be read.</p>

<p>Stack: The stack is a structure in which we can push and remove the items from one end only. It has an infinite size. In PDA, the stack is used to store the items temporarily.</p>
