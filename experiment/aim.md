### Aim of the Experiment

To design, construct, and analyze a **Pushdown Automaton (PDA)** that recognizes strings of a specified **Context-Free Language (CFL)**. The experiment aims to provide hands-on understanding of how a PDA operates, including the **role of states, stack operations, input processing, and transition rules**. Additionally, it demonstrates the connection between **context-free grammars and automata**, helping students visualize how abstract grammatical rules are implemented computationally.
