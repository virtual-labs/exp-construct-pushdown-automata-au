      "question": "How does the construction of a pushdown automaton (PDA) differ from that of a finite automaton (FA) when recognizing languages?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "PDAs are only constructed for regular languages, while FAs can recognize context-free languages.",
        "b": "PDAs use a stack for additional memory, enabling recognition of context-free languages.",
        "c": "PDAs have fewer states compared to FAs for the same language.",
        "d": "The construction process is identical for both PDAs and FAs."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Try again.",
