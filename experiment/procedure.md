<u><b>procedure</b></u>
<p>construct a pushdown automata for the language L=0<sup>n</sup>1<sup>n</sup> | n>=0  </p>
<p>In the given langauge  <b>L=0<sup>n</sup>1<sup>n</sup> | n>=0 </b>, the number of zeros and ones are in equal numbers. For example, if we consider the string "0011," the number of zeros and ones are equal.</p>

<p>In the interface, you can observe astate diagram and a stack along with a start button.</p>
<div><img src="./images/interface.png" alt="interface"><div>
<p>Click on the start button to observe the process of constructing a PDA</p>
<p>Carefully observe the state diagram along with the stack to understand the interactions between the stack and transitions between states.</p>
<p>Click on the next button to observe the step-by-step process of constructing a PDA, where you can witness each step progressing to create the PDA.</p>
